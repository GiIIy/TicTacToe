## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. It serves as a practice project for learning Java programming concepts.

## Features

- Graphical user interface with a 3x3 grid
- Two players taking turns (X and O)
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Tie detection

2. Compile and run the `board` class to launch the Tic Tac Toe game.
3. Click on the buttons to make your move (X or O).
4. The game will detect wins and ties and display the result.

## Code Structure

- The main game logic is contained within the `board` class.
